So I made this because I have this annoying problem where my cpu is like at very low usage & my gpu is at normal usage
It's basically a bottleneck but in reverse _I like to call it a neckbottle_

But I found out that changing the power plans fixes it for a few moments so this script keeps changing the power plan to basically remove this "neckbottle"

If you're having the same problem and want to use this then do note that you need to have the ultimate & balanced power plans unlocked
or change line 20 & line 23 to your desired power plans

Also if you want to launch this at startup then you can put the jar in your startup folder, you can find that folder by pressing **âŠž Win + R** and then typing **shell:startup**

_Also you need to have Java installed for this to work_
